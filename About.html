            <h1>
                About

            </h1>

            <p>
                Originally from Manchester (UK) and since moved to Leeds to further my career in Software Testing. Although I do not come from a technical background, my experience in the Software Testing Industry has allowed me to pursue my personal and professional goals, from developing and maintaining a functioning website to developing automated tests through several tools and programming languages. I also enjoy exploring new tastes through cooking and challenging myself to running when I can.
            </p>

            <h1>
                How did I get into Software Testing?
            </h1>

            <p>
                Prior to my career in Software Testing, I studied a Bachelor of Arts in Politics, Philosophy and Economics as an Undergraduate at The University of Manchester, followed by a Master of Science in Business Analysis and Strategic Management. One question which I am always asked is how and why I pursued a career in software testing given my studies in various and somewhat different subjects? It may be surprising that this was not a big jump, as during my undergraduate studies, I specialised in Political Science and Philosophical Logic which are both highly analytical subjects which I have transferred into widening my testing knowledge and technical skills. Whilst during my postgraduate studies, I specialised in areas such as innovation management and digital transformation where I was able to gain an insight into the wider elements of business change through increasing digital markets. Therefore, my decision to pursue a career in Software Testing is not as surprising as first expected as it utilises the skills and interests gained from my previous education.

            <h1>
                Why create a website from scratch when there are templates accessible?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Whilst I agree there are plenty of easy pre-made templates on the internet, there is nothing like creating something from scratch. This has meant that I have been able to challenge myself both from a technical perspective and explore creative aspects by not being restricted by predefined templates or designs. Therefore, it may be no surprise this site continues to change with incremental improvements and versions.
